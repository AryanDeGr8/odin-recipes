        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>New York pizza is often imitated but rarely duplicated.  Some believe the secret is in the water, or the cheese.  I’m here to demystify the process by sharing my homemade pizza dough recipe, and all my tips, tricks, and secrets with you.  By the time you’re done reading, you’ll understand why the cold-fermentation process is the true key to unlocking that unmistakable New York flavor and will have the confidence to go forth and make the <strong>BEST damn pizza</strong> you’ve ever tasted. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>

            <li><strong>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</strong></li><br>
            <li><strong>⅔ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</strong></li><br>
            <li><strong>2 cups all-purpose flour</strong></li><br>
            <li><strong>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</strong></li><br>
            <li><strong>1 teaspoon salt</strong></li><br>
            <li><strong>2 tablespoons olive oil</strong></li><br>
            <li><strong>1 (10 ounce) can tomato sauce</strong></li><br>
            <li><strong>1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese</strong></li><br>
            <li><strong>½ cup grated Romano cheese</strong></li><br>
            <li><strong>1 tablespoon dried oregano</strong></li><br>
            <li><strong>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</strong></li><br>
            <li><strong>2 tablespoons olive oil</strong></li><br>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Sprinkle yeast over surface of warm water in a large bowl. Let stand for 1 minute, then stir to dissolve. Mix in flour, salt, and olive oil. When dough is too thick to stir, turn out onto a floured surface and knead for 5 minutes. Knead in a little more flour if dough is too sticky. Place into an oiled bowl, cover, and set aside in a warm place to rise until doubled in bulk.</li> <br>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). If using a pizza stone, preheat it in the oven as well, setting it on the lowest shelf.</li> <br>
                <li>When dough has risen, flatten it out on a lightly floured surface. Roll or stretch out into a 12-inch circle, and place on a baking pan. If you are using a pizza stone, you may place it on a piece of parchment while preheating the stone in the oven.</li> <br>
                <li>Spread tomato sauce evenly over dough. Sprinkle with oregano, mozzarella cheese, basil, Romano cheese, and red pepper flakes.</li> <br>
                <li>Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until bottom of crust is browned when you lift up the edge a little, and cheese is melted and bubbly. Cool for about 5 minutes before slicing and serving.</li> <br>
            </ol>
        </p>
